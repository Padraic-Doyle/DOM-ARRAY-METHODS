# DOM-ARRAY-METHODS
simple app to practice array methods: map,reduce, filter,sort, foreach.

This app makes an api call to get random users names and assigns them an initial random balance between 1 and 1million pounds.
It then pushes users to a data array and updates the DOM.
Users can then click buttons to perform certain actions such as , add new user, show only millionaires, sort by richest and calculate the entire wealth of all users.
